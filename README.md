# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview of Analysis

  The project was to analyze ride-sharing data using different tools such as python, Matplotlib and Pandas. First thing we did was read the given CVS files which contained city data and ride data. We then combined them both into one sheet using merge() function. The next assignment was to figure out the Summary data frame followed by the second deliverable which was a chart. The assignment would help the ride-sharing companies see affordability in ride sharing services in the various parts of the country.  
  
 # Findings
  
  The first variable that we counted was the percentage of the total rides within each city type. The second was the percentage of the total drivers within the cities. Since we were given the fares as well, we also calculated the percentage of the fares. Lastly we found the average fare per ride and per driver. Last was the total fare by city type. For this finding, we have the graph below.

This graph shows the Fare by City type. The rural cities had the most expensive fares, followed by suburban and rural cities. We can also see that there seems to be a general inrease in prices in all city types between the months of January and April.
  
  #Results
  
  Based on the total rides by city types, we can see that the urban cities seemed to have 2/3 of the ride shares, followed by suburban and rural cities. We can see the same pattern with the percentage of drivers within each city type. We see that the rural areas had about 2% of the total population of drivers. 
  
  * we can see that cities that are rather underdeveloped have higher ride-sharing rates and citizens in that area can't really afford to use ride-sharing services. 
  * we see that suburban drivers were roughly 17% of the total. 
  * In order to ByPer to succeed, they would need to adjust their fare prices for the underserved communities and provide them with more drivers. It would also encourage the drivers to drive more if they have better benefits and are perhaps paid by the company as well.
